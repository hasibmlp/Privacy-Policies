  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: March 17, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Checkout Donation App ("the App") collects, uses, and protects data when integrated with your Shopify store. By installing and using our app, you agree to the practices described below.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>The App is designed to integrate donation options at checkout by creating and managing hidden donation products. It uses the Shopify Admin GraphQL API to perform these tasks. In doing so, the following data may be accessed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Store Information:</strong> Basic details like store name, domain, and settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Product Data:</strong> Information related to donation products (IDs, handles, etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>API Credentials:</strong> Secure API keys used solely for authentication with Shopify’s APIs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No personal customer data or sensitive merchant information is collected or stored by the App. All data is processed in accordance with Shopify’s guidelines.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use standard encryption and security measures to protect data transmitted between your store and Shopify’s servers. Data is only used to provide and improve the App’s functionality.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Integrations</h2>
  <p>The App does not share your store data with third parties. All processing is performed within Shopify's secure environment.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete the data related to your store that the App processes. If you have questions or concerns, please contact our support team.</p>
